.ls helpdb = "helpdb"
The filename of the help database to be examined.  The reserved name "helpdb"
causes the actual filename to be taken from the environment variable of
the same name.
.le
.ls verbose = no
If this switch is enabled, \fIhdbexamine\fR will print a detailed description
of the help database listing the modules in each package, the date the entry
for the package was last modified, and other information.  A more concise
summary listing only the packages and the number of help modules in each
package is printed by default.

.ih
DESCRIPTION
The \fIhdbexamine\fR task is used to examine the contents of a help
database.  By default the standard IRAF help database is examined.
Examining the help database with \fIhdbexamine\fR verifies that it can
be read by \fIhelp\fR, and may be useful as a diagnostic in the event
that an invalid help directory file (".hd") somewhere in the help
directory tree, causes the database to be compiled incorrectly.
.ih
EXAMPLES
1. Print a concise summary of the contents and structure of the standard
help database.
