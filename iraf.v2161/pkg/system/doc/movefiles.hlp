name as the destination directory, the subdirectory is used.

EXAMPLES

1. Move all files whose names start with `im' and end with `ab' to
the directory `dir'.  Since "verbose" defaults to "no", do the work silently.

	cl> movefiles im*ab dir

2. Move all files in the current directory into the directory one level up.

	cl> move * ..
