NAME
protect -- protect files from deletion
.ih
USAGE
protect files
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls files
A template specifying the file or files to be protected.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
\fIProtect\fR asserts protection from deletion for the specified files.
A protected file can be deleted only by first "unprotecting" it.
File protection is preserved when a file is copied or renamed,
even when copied or renamed to a remote network node,
but may be lost when a file is backed up on tape and later restored
(depending upon what utility one uses).  Note that imagefiles are
automatically protected to prevent accidental deletion of the header
file, leaving a "zombie" pixel file somewhere on disk.

EXAMPLES
