NAME
peaks -- find the peaks in an array of x and y points
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
npeaks = peaks (x, y, background, npts, dx)

real	x[npts], y[npts]	# Input data points and output peaks
real	background[npts]	# Background estimate
int	npts			# Number of input data points
real	dx			# Precision of peak positions

DESCRIPTION
The extrema in the input data points are found using extrema(xtools).
The extrema are located to a precision of dx.
The extrema with negative curvature (peaks) are selected and returned
in the x array.  The spline value is returned in the y array.  The
background is estimated by linear interpolation of the neighboring
minima (extrema of positive curvature) to the position of the peak.
The background is returned in the background array.  The number of
peaks found is returned as the function value.
