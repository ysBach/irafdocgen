NAME

USAGE

PARAMETERS
None.

DESCRIPTION
Output to graphics plotter devices is normally buffered and then disposed
of to the plotter as a larger job, to increase the efficiency of the
graphics system.  The \fIgflush\fR task disposes of any buffered graphics
output and also initializes the graphics subsystem.  The cursor mode frame
buffer is cleared, any connected graphics subkernels are disconnected,
and the memory and file descriptors used by the graphics subsystem are
freed.  A \fIgflush\fR occurs automatically upon logout from the CL.

The number of frames (plots) the graphics system will buffer for a device
is controlled by the MF (multi-frame) parameter in the \fIgraphcap\fR entry
for the device.  When the multi-frame count is reached the buffered output
is automatically disposed of to the device.
