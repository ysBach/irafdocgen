NAME
break -- break out of a loop
.ih
USAGE
break
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The \fIbreak\fR statement is used to exit (break out of) the \fIfor\fR or
\fIwhile\fR loop in which it is found.  In the case of nested loop constructs
only the innermost loop is terminated.
Unlike C usage the \fIbreak\fR statement does not break out of a switch.

EXAMPLES
1. Scan a list (file), printing each list element until either the list is
exhausted or a list element "exit" or "quit" is encountered.

.nf
	while (fscan (list, s1) != EOF) {
	    if (s1 == "exit" || s1 == "quit")
		break
	    print (s1)
	}
.fi


2. Sum the pixels in a two dimensional array, terminating the sum for each
line if a negative pixel is encountered, and terminating the entire process
when the total sum passes a predefined limit.

.nf
	total = 0
	for (i=1;  i <= NCOLS;  i+=1) {
	    for (j=1;  j <= NLINES;  j+=1) {
		if (pixel[i,j] < 0)
		    break		# exit the J loop
		total += pixel[i,j]
	    }
	    if (total > NPHOT)
		break			# exit the I loop
	}
.fi
