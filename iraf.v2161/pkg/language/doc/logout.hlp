.help logout Feb86 language

NAME
logout -- log out of the CL
.ih
USAGE
logout
.ih
DESCRIPTION
\fILogout\fR causes the CL to shut itself down, regardless of how many
packages may currently be active.  The only way to shut the CL down without
killing it is to use \fIlogout\fR; \fIbye\fR is not allowed to shut the
CL down, since it would be too easy to enter it by accident (and it takes
a while to log back in).

An error message will be printed if one attempts to log out of the CL while
a device is still allocated.  The device should be deallocated and the
\fIlogout\fR repeated, else type \fIlogout\fR several times and you will
be permitted to logout with the device still allocated.
