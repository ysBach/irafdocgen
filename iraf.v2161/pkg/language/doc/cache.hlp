.ih
USAGE

.ih
PARAMETERS

DESCRIPTION
The \fIcache\fR command loads the parameters of a task in memory.
The CL normally reads the parameters for a task from disk whenever the
task is executed.  Cacheing the parameters for frequently executed tasks
can speed up execution significantly.  This is particularly important when
the tasks are called from within a loop.

If the \fIcache\fR command is entered without any arguments a list of the
currently "cached" tasks is printed.

EXAMPLES
1. Cache the parameters for the tasks \fIdirectory\fR and \fIpage\fR.

	cl> cache dir page

2. Cache the parameters for the tasks called in a loop within the body of
a procedure script.  Note the use of command mode in the script.

.nf
	begin
		cache ("alpha", "beta")
		for (i=1;  i <= 10;  i+=1) {
		    alpha (i)
		    beta (i)
		}
	end
.fi

BUGS
The parameter cache should not be confused with the process cache associated
with the \fIprcache\fR and \fIflprcache\fR commands.
