DESCRIPTION
The \fIgoto\fR statement interrupts the normal flow of program execution by
transferring control to the statement following the label.  It may also be
used to exit from nested loops where the break statement is not adequate.
.ih
EXAMPLES
1. The most common use of the \fIgoto\fR statement is to branch to an error
handler if an abnormal condition is detected.

.nf
begin
	for (i=1;  i <= 100;  i += 1)
	    for (j=1;  j <= 100;  j += 1)
		for (k=1;  k <= 100;  k += 1)
		    if (pixel[i,j,k] < 0)
			goto err
		    else
			total += pixel[i,j,k]

	print ("total = ", total)
	return
err:
	print ("Invalid pixel value at ",i,j,k)
end
.fi
