NAME
keep -- keep memory after task termination
.ih
USAGE
keep
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Normally when a script task terminates any tasks, packages, environment
variables, etc. defined during the execution of that task are discarded
(in other words, the memory used by the task is freed).
The \fIkeep\fR command instructs the CL to retain the definitions after
script termination.  Only one level of "keep" is achieved, e.g.,
if a script with a keep is called from a higher level script, then when
the higher level script terminates the task definitions will still be lost
(unless this higher level script also uses \fIkeep\fR).

EXAMPLE
1. The most common use for \fIkeep\fR is to retain a set of definitions
in a script task.

.nf
	set	pkdir = "home$hebrew/"
	task	aleph, beth, kaph = hebrew.cl

	keep
.fi
