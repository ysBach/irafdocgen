NAME
jobs -- display the status of background jobs
.ih
USAGE
jobs

PARAMETERS
None.

DESCRIPTION
\fIJobs\fR is used to display the status of background jobs.
If no job number is specified then all the status of all background
jobs is displayed.  For each job there is one line of output, e.g.

    [2]  0:14 +Running  copy file1 file2 &

Here 2 is the job number of the job; 0:14 is the clock time in minutes and
seconds since the job was submitted; `Running' indicates that the task is
currently running while the `+' indicates that this was the last background
job started.   The remainder of the line is a copy of the actual command
used to start the job.

The possible states for a background job are:

.nf
	Done    -- the job has finished normally
	Exit N  -- the job terminated with exit code N
	Stopped -- the job is waiting for input from the user
			(see the \fIservice\fR command)
	Running -- the job is currently executing
.fi
.ih
EXAMPLES
.nf
cl> jobs
    [1]  21:13  Done      mkhelp >& dev$null & 
    [2]   0:05 +Running   count *.hlp > _junk & 
.fi
.ih
BUGS
Exit codes are rarely displayed when jobs terminate abnormally.
The CL checks for background job termination only when a command is
entered, hence the elapsed time shown will often be greater than it
should be.
