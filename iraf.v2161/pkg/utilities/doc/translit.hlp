NAME
translit -- replace or delete specified characters in a file
.ih
USAGE
translit infile from_string [to_string]
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls infile
The input file name or template, e.g. "abc" or "abc.*".
.le
.ls from_string
String containing characters to be mapped. 
If delete is yes then the characters in from_string are deleted from the input
file(s). The from_string may specify a range of characters, e.g. "a-z" or "A-Z".
If the first character of from_string is ^ then the program will operate
on all but the specified characters, e.g. "^a-z" means all but lower case
alphabetic characters.
.le
.ls to_string
Requested if delete is no, otherwise set to the null string.
Characters in from_string are mapped into characters in to_string.
When to_string is short with respect to from_string, it is padded
by duplicating the last character.
.le
.ls delete = no
If delete is yes the characters in from_string are deleted from the input
file(s) and no to_string is requested.
.le
.ls collapse = no
If this switch is set all strings of repeatedly mapped output characters
are squeezed to a single character.
