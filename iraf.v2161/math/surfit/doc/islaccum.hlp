NAME
islaccum -- accumulate a surface grid line into the fit
.ih
SYNOPSIS
include <math/surfit.h>

islaccum (sf, cols, lineno, z, w, npts, wtflag)

.nf
pointer	sf		# surface grid descriptor
int	cols[npts]	# column values, 1 <= col[i] <= ncols
int	lineno		# number of line, 1 <= lineno <= nlines 
real	z[npts]		# surface values on lineno at cols
real	w[npts]		# array of weights
int	npts		# number of surface values, npts <= ncols
int	wtflag		# type of weighting desired

ARGUMENTS
.ls sf      
Pointer to the surface grid descriptor structure.
.le
.ls cols
The column numbers of surface grid points on line lineno to be added to the
dataset.
.le
.ls lineno
The line number of the surface grid line to be added to the data set.
.le
.ls z      
The data values.
.le
.ls w
The array of weights for the data points.
.le
.ls npts
The number of surface grid values on line number lineno to be added to the
data set.
.le
.ls wtflag
Type of weighting. The options are SF_USER and SF_UNIFORM. If wtflag
equals SF_USER the weight for each data point is supplied by the user
and points with zero-valued weights are not included in the fit.
If wtflag equals SF_UNIFORM the routine sets the weights to 1.

DESCRIPTION
ISLACCUM computes the contribution of each data point to the normal
equations in x, sums that contribution into the appropriate arrays and
vectors and stores these intermediate results for use by ISLSOLVE.
.ih
NOTES
Checking for out of bounds col values and INDEF valued data points is
the responsibility of the calling program.
