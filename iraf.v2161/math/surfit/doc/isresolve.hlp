NAME
isresolve -- resolve the surface, same lines array
.ih
SYNOPSIS
include <math/surfit.h>

isresolve (sf, lines, ier)

.nf
pointer	sf		# surface grid descriptor
int	lines[nlines]	# surface grid line numbers, 1 <= lines[i] <= nlines
int	ier		# error code
.fi
.ih
ARGUMENTS
.ls sf     
Pointer to the surface grid descriptor structure.
.le
.ls nlines
The number of surface grid lines to be fit.
.le
.ls ier      
Error code returned by the fitting routines. The options are OK, SINGULAR,
and NO_DEG_FREEDOM. If ier = SINGULAR the matrix is singular, ISSOLVE
will compute a solution to the normal equations but one or more of the
coefficients will be zero. If ier = NO_DEG_FREEDOM, too few data points
exist for a reasonable solution to be computed. ISSOLVE returns without
fitting the data.

DESCRIPTION
In some applications it is necessary to refit the same surface several
times with the same lines array. In this case it is inefficient to reaccumulate
the matrices and calculate the Cholesky factorization for each fit.
ISERESOLVE reaccumulates only the right side of the equation.

NOTES
It is the responsibility of the calling program to check for out of bounds
lines values.
