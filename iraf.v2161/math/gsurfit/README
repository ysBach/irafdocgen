Linear least squares surface fitting package.
Contains routines to fit Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials
in the least squares sense to 2-dimensional data.
The normal equations are accumulated and solved using Cholesky factorization.
The package contains separate entry points for accumulating points,
solving the matrix equations, rejecting points and evaluating the surface.
