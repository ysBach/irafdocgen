This directory cotnains the original Fortran source for the Bevington
routines, as copied from his book.

Jun85	Removed the nonstandard & in col 1 UNIX style continuation and
	replaced it with standard Fortran (col 6) continuation.

Oct85   Added an extran continuation statement to chifit.f to avoid ambiguous
	transfer of control to statement 70

Nov85   It was possible to get a floating point divide by zero in regres.f
	when rmul=1 in the calculation in statement 135 of ftest.  The value
	of rmul (the correlation) is now tested before the division and a 
	value of ftest = -99999.  is returned when rmul=1.
