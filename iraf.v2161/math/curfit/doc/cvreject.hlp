DESCRIPTION
CVREJECT removes an individul data point from the data set.
The non-zero basis functions for each x are calculated. The contribution
of each x to the normal equations is computed and subtracted from the
appropriate arrays and vectors.
An array of points can be removed from the fit by repeated calls to CVREJECT
followed by a single call to CVSOLVE to calculate a new set of coefficients.
