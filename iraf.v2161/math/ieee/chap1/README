     This directory contains the IEEE routines from Chapter 1 -
Discrete Fourier Transform Programs.  Some of the routines are
provided here as separete files (fourea.f, wfta.f, ...) but are
purposely not put into the library, as these routines are not for
general use (fourea.f is an inefficient, demonstration version;
wfta.f is the Winograd DFT which is slower than the regular DFT
and uses far too much memory ona  16-bit machine to be of
practical use; ...).
     The directory "test" contains the test routines from the chapter.
The directory "time" contains some routines to time various of the
routines.
     The file "compall" compiles the appropiate routines and then
"mklib" will make the library, which one will probably want to
move to "/usr/lib/libieee.a".
