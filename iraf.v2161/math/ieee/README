     This directory contians programs and subroutines from the
text "Programs for Digital Signal Processing" by the IEEE Press.
Directories of the name "chap*" correspond to each chapter of
the text.
     The files "*mach*" are the machine dependent routines which
should be edited for the hardware which you are going to run the
routines on.  The file "uni.c" is a uniform random number generator,
not the one from the text, but one which uses the UNIX generator.
