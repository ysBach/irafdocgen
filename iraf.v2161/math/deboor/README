These directories contain the codes described in the book "A Practical Guide
to Splines", by Carl DeBoor, Springer-Verlag, 1978.  The directory math/deboor
contains the single precision routines.  The same routines, edited to provide
double precision, are in the directory "dblprec", which may disappear at some
point in the future if we decide we don't need these.  The directory "progs"
contains a number of example programs from the book.

A number of the routines herein write error messages using Fortran i/o,
violating our convention that numerical routines should not perform i/o.
These routines have been flagged by adding the suffix "_io".  These routines
have not been compiled and installed in the library "deboor.a".  The most useful
routines either did not do i/o, or have had the i/o removed (e.g., splint.f).

Note: use the new SPLLSQ for smoothing with splines, instead of L2APPR, if a
uniform knot sequence is desired.  Use BSPLN to evaluate the coefficient array
from SPLLSQ.

Oct 85	Rearranged the order of argument declarations in cwidth.f, dtblok.f,
	factrb.f, fcblok.f, sbblok.f, shiftb.f, slvblk.f, subbak.f, subfor.f
	to conform with Fortran standard
