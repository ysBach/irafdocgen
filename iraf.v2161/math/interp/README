Image interpolation package.  Contains interpolator routines specially
designed to interpolate image data.  This interpolator task is characterized
by data arrays in which the data points are equally spaced.  Data points
and interpolation points are referenced simply by array index.  Indefinite
valued pixels may be present in the data.  Since the interpolation routines
will be applied to very large data arrays, efficiency is emphasized in these
routines.
