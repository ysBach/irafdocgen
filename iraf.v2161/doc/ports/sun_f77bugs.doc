Different problems were encountered in both Sun-2's and Sun-3's
with the f77 compiler.  On the Sun-2, the problems were in the
optimizer.  See the "sun2*.doc" files for documentation on which
IRAF source files generated compile-time and run-time problems.

On the Sun-3, the worst problem was that Sun forgot about complex
datatypes after Sun V2.0.  See the notes in the "sun3*.doc" files.
Sun still (June 24) has not solved the problem, but Doug Tody came
up with workarounds; look for the string "kludge" in "sun3_042586.doc"
and in the directory $iraf/unix/hlib/SUN_kludge/.

There were also three IRAF source files that generated run-time
errors on the Sun-3 due to bugs in the "-f68881" version of the f77
optimizer; these files are documented in "sun3_f77Obugs.doc".
