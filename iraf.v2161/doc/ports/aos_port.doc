                                to 1024, because of the error:
                                Warning: File Read Error (STDIN) when doing
                                set | match tty ... or ... type x | type
                                where x was 1024 or more bytes long.  This error                                was followed by a hangup on logout, apparently
                                waiting for the sub-process to die after sending                                it 'bye'.  The kernel routine ZFIOPR was tested
                                to record lengths of 4096 with no problems.  I
                                don't understand this; it looks like a weird
