This directory contains notes on the various IRAF ports.  Most of these
files do not contain an up-to-date record of the current ports, but rather
these are historical notes taken during each port.  The name of the host
operating system is contained in each filename, while most files contain
the relevant dates of ports or upgrades inside them.  Some of this material
may be of use to persons contemplating future ports.

Where different files would otherwise have the same name, they are
distinguished by the date of the last modification to the system that
was part of the original "notes" file.  For example, "sun3_062486.doc"
is the "notes" file as it existed on a Sun-3 on June 24, 1986.
