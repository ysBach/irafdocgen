SUN/IRAF V2.3 Installation, 12 June 1986	Sun-3, MC68881 floating point
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/usr/iraf/local/notes
	Began this new notes file.  All subsequent pathnames assume
	"/usr/iraf/" preceding them.  (6/12)

unix/
	Made a tar backup in /tmp2/iraf/tuc_unix.arc.  (6/12)

local/
	Made a tar backup in /tmp2/iraf/tuc_local.arc.  (6/12)

bin/
lib/
pkg/
sys/
unix/
	Ran rmbin to remove all binary files.  (6/12)

/usr/iraf/
	Unpacked new "wtar -o" source-only archive from lyra.  (6/12)

unix/as/
unix/mc68000
	Replaced VAX contents of as/ with those from mc68000; renamed
	.SUN's to .s's.  (6/12)

unix/mkpkg.csh
	Replaced with the one from the archive; contains SUN_kludge
	mkpkg.csh command.  (6/12)

unix/hlib/[dir]1mach.f
	Replaced with those from archive for 68000; using MC68000
	versions of machine-independent stuff for nspp software.  (6/12)

unix/hlib/mach.h
	Compared with archive and replaced with archive version to pick
	up BYTE_SWAP[24] = NO, and to use the 68000 fp epsilons.  (6/12)

unix/hlib/motd
	Short message about SUN/IRAF system testing.  (6/12)

unix/hlib/mkpkg.inc
	Ran diff; replaced from archive to pick up 68000 compiler
	and linker switches for this SUN-3, which has MC 68881 floating
	point (XFLAGS -c -O -f68881; LFLAGS -f68881).  Set USE_CALCOMP
	to NO.  (6/12)

unix/hlib/mkiraf.csh
	Replaced iraf root definition.  (6/12)

unix/hlib/libc/iraf.h
	Changed root directory to /usr/iraf/, added "#define SUN3".  (6/12)

unix/hlib/libc/kernel.h
	Commented out DEBUGMEM so that the normal UNIX malloc() is
	used.  This was and probably still is necessary in order to
	link with SUNCGI.  (6/12)

unix/hlib/libc/spp.h
	Ran diff; replaced with archive version to pick up MC68000
	fp epsilons.  (6/12)

unix/boot/mkpkg/host.c
	Changed SZ_CMD from 512 to 400 to get around SUN-3 f77 command-
	line bug.  (6/12)

unix/boot/spp/xc.c
	Ran diff; replaced with archive version to pick up all the
	extra Fortran library definitions and command-line args.  (6/12)

unix/os/zxwhen.c
	Ran diff; replaced with archive version to pick up Sun floating
	point exception definitions.  (6/12)

local/notes
	Renamed to notes.vax.  (6/12)

local/login.cl
	Renamed root directory in "home"; aliased "xc" to "xc -f68881".  (6/12)

/usr/include/iraf.h	-> $hlib/libc/iraf.h
	Made sure this symbolic link existed.  (6/12)

unix/	[BOOTSTRAP]
	Attempted bootstrap ("sh -x mkpkg.csh").  (6/12)

unix/boot/bootlib/mkpkg.csh
	This time the bootstrap failed because of the "unexpected end of
	file" error and did NOT create libboot.a.  Resolved by inserting
	"#! /bin/csh -f" as the first line.  (6/13)

unix/	[BOOTSTRAP]
	Successful bootstrap this time.  (6/13)
	
unix/hlib/alloc.e
	Changed ownership to root in order to allocate devices at runtime.
	(6/13)

/usr/bin/alloc		-> $hlib/alloc.e
/usr/bin/generic	-> $hlib/generic.e
/usr/bin/mkpkg		-> $hlib/mkpkg.e
/usr/bin/rmbin		-> $hlib/rmbin.e
/usr/bin/rmfiles	-> $hlib/rmfiles.e

/usr/bin/wtar		-> $hlib/wtar.e
/usr/bin/xc		-> $hlib/xc.e
/usr/bin/cl		-> $hlib/cl.e
	Made sure these symbolic links existed.  (6/13)

	Hand-compiled without "-f68881" switch (but with optimization);
	otherwise the compiler fails due to complex datatype expressions.
	This will be the case until the next Sun f77 release.  (6/13)

sys/fmtio/fprfmt.x				F77 run-time
	Hand-compiled without optimization (but with "-f68881").  Have not
	yet determined source of problem (symptom was garbage appearing
	in text files) -- pursue shortly.  (6/13)

$iraf
	Started sysgen at 10:22.  (6/13)

dev/devices
	Replaced with version from suntest!, since we now have a 1/2 inch
	tape drive on tucana.  Added mtb entry for the 1/4 inch drive.  (6/13)

noao$onedspec/getnimage.x			F77 run-time
	There is a bug in the optimizer which seems to be caused by a
	logical comparison to MAX_INT.  To get around the problem do the
	following after a full sysgen.  (6/19)

		touch getnimage.x; mkpkg xflags=-c fluxcal; mkpkg install

$iraf
	Unpacked an incremental archive from lyra to bring tucana up
	to current as of 09:15 June 20, 1986.  Performed an incremental
	sysgen.  (6/20)

noao/twodspec/apextract/*
	The preceding MKPKG found the entire contents of icfit/* missing
	except for 3 source files.  To be safe, I (sr) made a complete
	archive of lyra!/...apextract/* and unpacked it here, followed
	by another root sysgen.  (6/20)

noao/twodspec/apexold/*
	Because this directory was created by renaming the directory
	apextract after the full archive of June 12, it had old file
	dates and the incremental archives this week didn't pick it
	up.  Unpacked a full archive and MKPKG'd.  (6/20)

sys/gio/cursor/grcwcs.x				F77 run-time
	Apparent f77 optimizer bug; hand-compiling w/o optimization
	and relinking the CL clears up the problem of IMPLOT's "l"
	and "c" commands returning bad pixel rows/columns.  Before,
	clgcur was sometimes returning the y coordinate in pixel, 
	rather than data, units -- i.e. in WCS 1 rather than 2.  Haven't
	had time to try to isolate the source of the optimizer bug.  (6/21)

$iraf
	Unpacked an incremental archive from lyra! current to 14:40 June
	21; performed an incremental sysgen.  (6/21)

noao/mtlocal/r2df/r2df.com
	The preceding sysgen died because this file was missing; it had 
	a date earlier than the incremental archive, so was missed.
	Added it and rebuilt mtlocal.  (6/21)

$iraf
	Unpacked an incremental archive from lyra! current to 08:15 June
	23; performed an incremental sysgen.  (6/23)

noao/lib/scr/*
noao/twodspec/apextract/*
noao/twodspec/apexold/*
	Unpacked full, not incremental, archives from lyra! to pick up any
	files missed during the incremental archives as a result of renaming
	rather than copying files since the June 12 full archive.  mkpkg
	updates in both apextract directories.  (6/23)

pkg/cl/unop.c
	Changed call to sscanf (sval, "%f", &rresult) in case OP_REAL to
	sscanf (sval, "%lf", &rresult) because "rresult" is declared type
	"double", and on the SUNs, sscanf was only writing into the first
	four bytes of rresult, giving erroneous answers to REAL coercion,
	as in "cl> =real(imgets.value)".  Should be changed on master system
	as well.  (6/23)
