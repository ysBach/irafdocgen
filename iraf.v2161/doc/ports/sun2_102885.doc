deleted all .[aoe] files (22 Mb)
not necessary to edit Makefiles

/usr/include/iraf.h
	Made symbolic link in pointing to /iraf/lib/libc/iraf.h; necessary
	before compiling any C programs.

built mklib.e
built preprocessor: xc.e, xpp.e, rpp.e
built generic.e	(had to do this manually; no Makefile)
	lex generic.l; cc lex.yy.c -lln -o generic.e

/usr/bin
	Made symbolic links for unix tasks cl, xc, mklib, mkiraf

lib/*.e
	Made symbolic links for xc.e, xpp.e, rpp.e, mklib.e generic.e

lib/libc/spp.h
lib/mach.h
	Changed defn of machine epsilon (use Fort program in osb).
	Set byte swap flags to NO.

sys/os/zsvjmp.s
	Replaced VAX version with MC68000 version.

sys/osb/bitpak.s
sys/osb/bitupk.s
sys/osb/bytmov.s
	Edited Makelib to replace bitpak.s and bitupk.s with the portable
	version in bitfields.c.  Likewise replaced bytmov.s with bytmov.c.

sys/vops/ak/Makelib
sys/vops/lz/Makelib
	Commented out the VAX .s optimized files in the Makelib, and
	uncommented the portable .x versions.

cd sys; make >& spool &			# start sysgen of system libraries
	(pass c2 of f77 hung in infinite loop on fio$fstati.f; optimizer bug)

cd libc; mklib -O >& spool &		# make libc.a (C runtime library)


(peruse output from sysgen and fix compile time bugs)
----------------------------------

sys/gio/gki/gkigetwcs.x
	Array 'ret' no longer used, deleted.

sys/vops/achtXY
	When datatype X is the same as Y, the loop variable I is not used
	(no action taken).

pkg/softools/boot/spp/xpp/decl.c
	The XPP declarations code which output the argument list for a
	procedure could sometimes generate an output line too long for RPP to
	handle.  The code was breaking the argument list after 8 arguments
	had been output, a simplistic technique which would fail when the
	identifiers were too large.  Changed to keep track of the output
	column and break lines that are close to 80 cols in length.

sys/libc/ckimapc.c
	Local variable maxch redefines argument; argument maxch not used to
	control length of output string.

pkg/system/x_systest.x
pkg/system/system.cl
	Procedure mtdevlist was still being referenced in this package.

(system package, cl came up with no problems)


cd math; make >& spool &
-------------------------------------

math/Makefile
math/Makelib
	Added a Makelib to the math directory, with an entry for each math
	package.  Set up Makefile to make all the libraries.  Must still 
	be linked to lib when done, if not already.

math/bevington/matinv.f
	Apparent optimizer failure in matinv.f.  Recompiled successfully
	without optimization.

(all other math libraries compiled successfully; linked em all into /iraf/lib)


cd /iraf; csh -x Mkpkg.sh >& spool &
-----------------------------------------------

pkg/*/Mkpkg.sh
	The "rm -f *.e" causes the script to abort without doing anything if
	there is no .o or .e file to delete.  Got around this with a temporary
	fix, i.e, making a junk.e in each directory before doing the rm.

As expected, the links failed due to the following libraries not being present
in lib$ yet:

	all math libraries		math/
	xtools				pkg/xtools
	nspp				sys/gio/nspp
	ncar				sys/gio/ncarutil
	gks				sys/gio/gks
	calcomp				local UNIX (not IRAF) library

sys/gio/ncarutil/ishift.s
sys/gio/nspp/ishift.s
	Wrote SUN/MC68000 version.

sys/gio/nspp/*
	The usual complaints about questionable or nonportable constructs
	in the NCAR fortran.

sys/gio/nspp/nspp/gridal.f
	Optimizer failure.

sys/gio/nspp/utilities/conrec.f
	Invalid hollerith specification on line 387; count is incorrect due
	to continuation.  Changed to quoted string.

pkg/Mkpkg.sh
	Reordered packages to make the lower level packages first.
	In particular, imred cannot be made until after onedspec.

pkg/softools/boot/spp/xc.c
pkg/softools/boot/spp/xpp/xppmain.c
	Added a fflush(stderr) after each write to stderr.  On the SUN stderr
	appears not to be flushed automatically when i/o is redirected to an
	ordinary file.

pkg/dataio/lib/cyboow.s
	Wrote a stubbed out SPP version of these procedures so that the DATAIO
	package can be linked.

pkg/images/tv/display/t_mkdisplay.x
	Changed the obsolete IM_PIXELS to IM_PIXOFF.

pkg/twodspec/longslit/Makefile
	Would not make the library before linking, causing a rebuild to fail.
	x_aperture.e was made first, but mklib was called only for x_longslit.e.

ADB usage note:
	Breakpoints should be set at procedure+4 to get a correct stack trace
	showing the arguments to the procedure (vs. +2 on the VAX).

pkg/twodspec/longslit/Makefile (etc. in subdirs)
	Turned off the -F -g; this is for debugging and should NOT be turned
	on in an installed package (the images are larger and there is no
	optimization).  Also, the f77 compiler aborted with a DBX error
	related to a call to an external procedure passed as an argument to
	a procedure (file igsfit.f).  I did not investigate further; hand
	compilation of the procedure worked.

sys/libc/cfpath.c
	The third (maxch) argument was being passed to FPATHNAME by value
	rather than by reference.

dev/uhosts
dev/hosts
dev/hostlogin
	Added more machines to the network tables.

pkg/images/Mkpkg.sh
	Added entry for subpackage imdebug.

pkg/images/imdebug/Mkpkg.sh
	New file.

dev/helpdb
	Recompiled the help database (in the CL using the mkhelp task in the
	softools package).

sys/libc/cfmapfn.c
	The third (maxch) argument was being passed to FPATHNAME by value
	rather than by reference.

pkg/system/allocate.cl
	As a temporary fix, commented out the call to UNIX to allocate a
	device.  Removed the enumerated device names from the parameter file
	since device names are not constant strings (this was never correct).
