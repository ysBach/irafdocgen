This directory contains the IRAF Formatted I/O (FMTIO) routines.  The FMTIO
package includes the string utilities (str___), character utilities (chr___),
encode/decode primitives (ctod, itoc, etc.), and the high level SCAN and
PRINTF routines.  This is a full implementation of FMTIO (excluding the
language dependent features that will be provided when the full language
becomes available).
