VOPS -- Vector OPerators

This directory contains the (generic) source for the vector operators (VOPS).
These generic procedures are expanded into a set of type specific procedures
by the GENERIC preprocessor, before compilation by XC.  Documentation for
the vector operators and for the GENERIC preprocessor is in Vops.hlp.

The subdirectory "achtgen" contains code for generalized datatype conversion
of vectors.  The highest level routine, "acht" implements a full 9 by 9
type conversion matrix (BUcsilrdx) (the BU are in OSB).
