This directory contains the IRAF File I/O (FIO) routines.  This version of
FIO fully implements revision 5 of the FIO interface as described in Fio.hlp.
Internally, however, the buffer management code has been simplified by
restricting the number of buffers to one per file, and omitting global buffers.
These features will be added in an upcoming revision of FIO.  No modifications
to the external specifications of the FIO interface should be necessary.
