NAME
imopnc -- open a new copy of an existing image
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
imopnc (nimage, oim, nim, ier)

character*(*)	nimage		#I host name of the new image
integer		oim		#I image descriptor of existing image
integer		nim		#O image descriptor of the new image
integer		ier		#O status return
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The \fIimopnc\fR procedure is used to open a new copy of an existing image,
copying the non-pixel fields of the old image header to the new image.
The new image must be the same size and datatype as the old image.
The new image is created, the header information is copied, and the pixel
file is allocated, but no pixel data is copied, and the \fIdatamin\fR and
\fIdatamax\fR fields of the image header are reset to zero.  The new image
is opened for read-write access and the image descriptor of the new image
is returned in \fInim\fR.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
A zero status value is returned if the operation is successful, i.e., if
\fIoim\fR is a valid image descriptor of an existing image already opened
with \fIimopen\fR or \fIimopnc\fR, the new image was successfully created,
and the header was successfully copied.

NOTES
If it is desired that the new image be of a different size or datatype than
the old image, the new image must be explicitly created with \fIimcrea\fR,
opened with \fIimopen\fR, and the old header copied with \fIimhcpy\fR.
