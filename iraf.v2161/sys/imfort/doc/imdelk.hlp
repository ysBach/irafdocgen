.ih
SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
The \fIimdelk\fR procedure is used to delete a user defined image header
keyword, e.g., a keyword previously created with \fIimaddk\fR or with one
of the \fIimakw\fR procedures.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
A zero status is returned if the named keyword existed, was a user defined
keyword (rather an a protected system keyword), and was successfully deleted.

.nf
SYS_IDBNODEL:	cannot delete image header keyword
SYS_IDBDELNXKW:	attempt to delete a nonexistent image header keyword
.fi
.ih
NOTES
It is not an error to delete a keyword from the header of an image opened for
read-only access, but an error status will be returned at \fIimclos\fR or
\fIimflsh\fR time since the header cannot be updated on disk.
