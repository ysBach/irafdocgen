NAME
clrawc -- return the raw command line as a string
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
subroutine clrawc (outstr, ier)

character*(*)	outstr		#O receives the command line string
integer		ier		#O status return
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The \fIclrawc\fR procedure returns the raw command line as a string,
i.e., all the argument strings are concatenated together with spaces
between successive arguments.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
A status of zero indicates that the task was called with a nonnull command
string.  An error status indicates that the program was called without any
arguments.

IE_GCMDLN:	cannot read command line string
.ih
NOTES
Normally it is preferable to use the \fIclarg\fR procedures to decode
and return the values of the individual arguments.  Note that decoding
the argument list with a list-directed read against \fIoutstr\fR is in
violation of the Fortran 77 standard, and probably would not work anyhow,
since the string arguments are not quoted.
