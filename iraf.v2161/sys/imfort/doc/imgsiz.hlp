NAME
imgsiz -- determine the size and datatype of an open image
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
subroutine imgsiz (im, axlen, naxis, dtype, ier)

integer		im		#I image descriptor of open image
integer		axlen(7)	#O length of each axis
integer		naxis		#O number of axes (dimensionality)
integer		dtype		#O pixel datatype
integer		ier		#O status return
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The \fIimgsiz\fR procedure is called to determine the dimensionality, size,
and datatype of an open image, i.e., the physical attributes of the pixel
array.  Upon output, \fIaxlen\fR will contain the length of each axis of
the image, where \fIaxlen(1)\fR is the number of pixels in each image line
(the number of columns), \fIaxlen(2)\fR is the number of lines in each band
of the image, \fIaxlen(3)\fR is the number of bands, and so on.
Seven array elements are returned regardless of the actual dimensionality of
the image; the lengths of the excess axes are set to one.  The logical
dimensionality of the image is returned in \fInaxis\fR.  A code identifying
the datatype of the pixels is returned in \fIpixtype\fR; the range of possible
pixel datatypes is enumerated in the table below.

.nf
	3	short integer (usually 16 bits signed)
	4	integer (generally the same as long integer)
	5	long integer (usually 32 bits signed)
	6	single precision floating (real)
	7	double precision floating
	8	complex
       11	unsigned short (16 bits unsigned)
.fi

Note that although the image storage format may support all of these datatypes,
IMFORT is currently only capable of accessing images of type short or real.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
A zero status is returned for any valid open image, i.e., provided the image
descriptor given is valid.

IE_MAGIC:	illegal imfort image descriptor
