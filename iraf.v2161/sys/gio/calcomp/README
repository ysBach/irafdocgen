GIO Calcomp kernel

This directory contains source for the IRAF calcomp graphics kernel.
Specifications may be found in ccpspecs.hlp.  Installation involves
building the kernel task, which is accomplished using "make" (Makefile)
with argument "install" to move the executable into lib$.

In addition to the kernel task routines, the vttest.x routine contains code 
to simulate calcomp software on standard gio graphics devices.  vttest.x
contains all the source for the simulation, using parameter file vttest.par.
Here, the calcomp routines "plot", "plots", "newpen", and "symbol" are
replaced with appropriate gio calls (violating interfaces) and to be used
mainly for testing text fonts, line type and width simulation.

TODO:

- super-bold font
- bold + italic

- multiples of dash, dot for linetypes numbered higher than 4

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (much work):

1)  Sophisticated parallel-tracing algorithm that looks at entire array
    and merges intersections so that all adjacent segments are parallel
    to each other and do not cross the acute bisector.  Implemented by
    parallel array segments rather than drawing each parallel segment
    individually, to avoid pen overtravel on short choppy lines.

2)  Panelling: when plot width exceeds available paper width, wrap graphics
    to beyond maximum x so that paper can be cut and pasted.

3)  Versatec extension with area-fill.
