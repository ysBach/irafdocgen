The original source is in the file "plot.4.8.sav".  If any modifications
have to be made, they will be recorded here.

REVISIONS

04Mar84 SET --> SPPSET
	The name of the SET module, used to set the device window and
	user coordinate system, was changed to SPPSET.  The module "set.x"
	in the high level code intercepts calls by the utilities to set,
	so that the transformations may be stored away in a file for recovery
	by another process.

05Mar84 Elimination of Fortran i/o
	All formatted writes to mprint were commented out.

05Mar48 Resolve library conflict
	getchr --> ncgchr		[collision with fio.getchar]
	putchr --> ncpchr		[for consistency with above]

12Mar84 Moved most of the initialization from the block data z8zpbd into
	the initialization subroutine z8zpii, called by nspp_init at
	GOPEN time.

12Dec85 SPPSET -> SET
	Changed this guy back, as the high level interface to the system
	plot package is no longer used.  The NCAR system plot package stuff
	is only used by the GIO/NCAR kernel now.
