This directory contains the source for GIOTR and cursor mode, i.e., the code
required to process the graphics output of a graphics task, spooling and/or
applying the workstation transformation and passing the transformed metacode
instructions on to the builtin STDGRAPH kernel or to an external kernel.  The
procedure RCURSOR is the main entry point for cursor mode.  RCURSOR is called
by the CL to service a query for a cursor type parameter when query mode is
in effect.  The workstation transformation is used to zoom and pan on a frame
buffer and consists of a viewport transformation in GKI coordinates with
clipping at the viewport boundary.
