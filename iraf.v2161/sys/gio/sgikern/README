SGIKERN -

This directory contains the source for the simple GIO kernel, used to write
a metacode file using only the simplest possible drawing instructions.  This
makes it relatively easy to implement functional (but probably suboptimal)
translators for new devices.

Special graphcap entries used by this kernel:

	MF		maximum frame count per metafile
	FS		frame advance req'd at start of metafile
	FE		frame advance req'd at end of metafile
