Directory gio$ncarutil, with subdirectories conlib, autograph and sysint, 
contains the source code for the GKS based NCAR plotting utilities library.
The first public release of this software was installed in IRAF 10SEP86.
(The 3 previous installations of the NCAR Utilities were the result of NOAO
serving as a Beta release test site.)  What follows is the Notes files from
the installation :

******************************************************************************
Notes for installation of the NCAR GKS based plotting utilities.  This
release marks the end of NCAR's beta testing and is the first public release
of the new software.  The changes made at NOAO have been merged into the
new source code; these changes have are marked with "+/- NOAO."  The IRAF
installed NCAR library differs from the version released on tape as documented
below.  Installation was begun September 2, 1986.  (S. Hammond)

Subdirectory AUTOGRAPH --

autograph/agback.f:
    Calls blockdata agdflt as run time subroutine.
autograph/agcurv.f:
    Calls blockdata agdflt as run time subroutine.
autograph/agdflt.f:
    This is the block data, which has been completely rewritten as
    initialization statements instead of data statements.
autograph/agexax.f:
    A ftn write statement has been commented out.
autograph/agppid.f:
    A string is written with f77upk/pstr instead of a ftn write statement.
autograph/agrstr.f:
    Binary read, completely commented out.
autograph/agsave.f:
    Binary write (opposite of agrstr.f), completely commented out.
autograph/agscan.f:
    Calls blockdata agdflt as run time subroutine.
    A ftn write statement has been commented out.
autograph/agsetp.f:
    Calls blockdata agdflt as run time subroutine.
autograph/agstup.f:
    Calls blockdata agdflt as run time subroutine.
autograph/ezmxy.f, ezmy.f, ezxy.f, ezy.f:
    These four subroutines require identical changes:
	Call blockdata agdflt as run time subroutine upon entering;
	Call subroutine initag before returning.
autograph/idiot.f:
    Call blockdata adgflt as run time subroutine.
    Call plotit and initut to reinitialize before returning.
autograph/pstr.x:
    This file is not on the distribution tape, it was written to
    output strings that have been unpacked by f77upk.

Subdirectory CONLIB --

conlib/conecd.f:
    Character variables IT and CHTMP are not used and so are commented out.
    The FTN internal writes are rewritten as calls to encode.
conlib/congen.f:
    FTN internal write replaced with call to encode.
conlib/conop1.f,conop2.f,conop3.f,conop4.f:
    These four routines now call blockdata conbdn as run time initialization.
conlib/conout.f, conot2.f:
    Both these routines are no-ops in IRAF.  All statements have been commented
    out.
conlib/conpdv.f:
    FTN internal write replaced with a call to encode.
conlib/conssd.f:
    FTN write and format statement commented out.
conlib/contng.f:
    FTN internal writes rewritten as calls to encode.


Directory NCARUTIL --

conran.f:
    Changed values of iabove, ibelow and ibel2 to improve label placement.
    Blockdata condbn rewritten as run time initialization. (conbdn.f)
    Internal writes rewritten as calls to encode.

conrec.f:
    Value of NCRT changed from 4 to 2.
    The contour plot labelling has been improved, with the titles being
    centered in the current viewport, and the large spaces between
    fields eliminated.  This change involves:
	1. common block noaolb added; also used in spp calling routine.
	2. Values of LNGTHS array modified.
	3. Character*25 variable string[5] added.
	4. Default plot position is centered on current viewport.
    All internal writes have been replaced with calls to encode.
    Error message concerning "overflow in STLINE" is now written only
        to stderr, not to stdgraph as well.
    EZCNTR no longer calls frame.
    Block data CONBD deleted from conrec.f source, rewritten as conbd.f

dashsmth.f:
    In two places, the blockdata DASHBD is called as an initializing subroutine.
    Subroutines kurv1s and kurv2s are used for both the dashsmth and
    isosrf utilities.  The code is duplicated in the two fortran files.  I
    have put it in a separate file (kurv.f) and deleted it from both original
    locations.

gridal.f:
    In two places, blockdata GRIDT is called as an initializing subroutine.
    All internal FTN writes changed to calls to encode.
    FTN write and format statements for error reporting deleted - used seter.
    Blockdata deleted from gridal.f; rewritten in gridt.f.

hafton.f:
    Blockdata hfinit rewritten and called as run time initializing subroutine.
    One internal write rewritten as call to encode.
    Call to FRAME removed from EZHFTN.

isosrf.f:
    Call to FRAME removed from EZISOS
    Blockdata isosrb was rewritten as run time initialization isosrb.f
    Source for subroutines kurv1s and kurv2s has been deleted from isosrf.f.
    (It is shared with the dashsmth utility, and has been moved to kurv.f.)

pwrity.f:
    Blockdata PWRYBD rewritten as subroutine.
    FTN writes and format statements commented out.

pwrzs.f:
    Common block noaovp added, so user can control viewport.  Calls to
    plotit and set had to be changed because they assumed the full
    viewport [1-1024] was being used for srface plots.

srface.f:
    Because user changes viewport when labelling is selected, mods had
    to be made.  Common block noaovp has been added, and calls to set
    and plotit no longer assume the full viewport [1-1024] is being used.
    Blockdata SRFABD has been rewritten as a run time initialization.

strmln.f:
    The value of uvmsg changed from 1.0E+36 to 1.0E+16 in an attempt
    to make this routine run on a VAX.

threed.f:
    Blockdata threbd rewritten as run time initialization.
    Subroutine pwrz completely commented out.

velvct.f:
    Blockdata veldat rewritten as run time initialization.
    FTN internal write rewritten as call to encode.


Subdirectory SYSINT (system interface) --

sysint/support.f:
    1. The character size calculated by WTSTR is doubled to be readable
       with the IRAF font.
    2. Subroutines SETER and E9RIN both used FTN write statements to
       output information.  This is now handled by passing the error 
       message to ULIBER, where the string gets unpacked with f77upk
       and written to stderr.
    3. Blockdata UERRBD was rewritten as a run time initialization.
    4. Block data UTILBD was rewritten as a run time initialization.
       A logical flag (first) was added to insure that the internal
       parameters were initialized only once per load; subroutine
       utilbd can be called at several points.  An entry point 'utinit'
       was added to reset the 'first' flag to true.
    5. In an attempt to mimic the organization of the release tape, file
       support.f contains the following fortran subroutines: 
       SUBROUTINE ENCD (VALU,ASH,IOUT,NC,IOFFD)
       SUBROUTINE ENCODE (NCHARS, FTNFMT, FTNOUT, RVAL)
       SUBROUTINE ENTSR(IROLD,IRNEW)
       SUBROUTINE RETSR(IROLD)
       SUBROUTINE ERROF
       SUBROUTINE SETER(MESSG,NERR,IOPT)
       SUBROUTINE EPRIN
       SUBROUTINE E9RIN(MESSG,NERR,SAVE)
       SUBROUTINE FDUM
       SUBROUTINE Q8QST4(NAME,LBRARY,ENTRY,VRSION)
       INTEGER FUNCTION NERRO(NERR)
       INTEGER FUNCTION I8SAV(ISW,IVALUE,SET)
       SUBROUTINE WTSTR (PX,PY,CH,IS,IO,IC)
       subroutine uerrbd
       subroutine uliber (errcode, pkerrmsg, msglen)

sysint/spps.f:
    1. Subroutine FLUSH has been renamed MCFLSH because of a name conflict.
    2. FRAME calls initut to initialize the 'first' flag in utilbd.
    3. Subroutines OPNGKS and CLSGKS have been commented out.
    4. In PLOTIT and PLOTIF the block data utilbd is called as a run time 
       initialization subroutine.

****************************************************************************

gio$ncarutil/conrec.f Dec 23, 1986 S. Hammond
        Moved the call to gsplci that set up major contours.  This
    statement was not being executed until after the first major line
    had been drawn, resulting in the first major line not being bold.

February 12, 1988.  During Steve Rooke's port of IRAF to the HP RISC computer
several Fortran errors were caught by the HP compiler.  These have been
fixed as shown:
sys/gio/ncarutil/conbdn.f
    The data statement at line 244 had not been commented out.  It is now.

June 10, 1988.  Made a mod to conbd.f (and in the comments to conrec.f) that
resets the point at which contour decides an image aspect ratio is "extreme".
Previously if the image axes ratio exceeded 1:4 the contour plot was square.
This limit was too restrictive and has been changed to 1:16.  See related 
change in pkg$plot.vport.x.
