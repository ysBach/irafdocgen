This directory contains the source for the TTY interface, a device independent
interface used to control terminals.  We interface to the widely used
TERMCAP terminal database, thereby gaining the data required to control many
diverse terminals.  (Written Jan84 dct).

Mar84	Added TTYGDES and the "graphcap" file, used to describe graphics
	devices.

Jly84	Added capability to compile selected termcap entries to speedup
	TTYODES.  Added TTYCOMPILE, TTYLOAD, TTYOPEN, TTYCLOSE.  Modified
	the existing routines TTYODES and TTYGDES.  The new open and close
	routines are useful for any type of database maintained in termcap
	format.

Jly84	Entry point TTYCLINE changed to TTYCLEARLN to avoid name conflict
	with TTYCLOSE.

Jly84	Task MKTTYDATA is used to compile selected entries from TERMCAP
	files.  The include files "cache_?.dat" are the output of this
	program.  To tailor the cache of pre-compiled termcap device
	entries for a site, compile MKTTYDATA and run it to generate
	the files "cache_t.dat" for "dev$termcap" (default MKTTYDATA params)
	and "cache_g.dat" for "dev$graphcap", then do a Sysgen to recompile
	the libraries.  All programs which use the TTY interface, e.g.,
	the SYSTEM package, must then be relinked to make use of the new
	cache.

Jun85	Changed filenames to make them more machine independent.
	Installed MKTTYDATA as a task in the SOFTOOLS package.
