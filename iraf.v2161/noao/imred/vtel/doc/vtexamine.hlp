NAME
vtexamine -- examine the headers and record structure of vacuum telescope files
.ih
USAGE
mtexamine tape_file
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls tape_file
Tape file, e.g. "mta1600[2]" or "mta1600".
.le
.ls files
List of tape file numbers or
ranges delimited by commas, e.g. "1-3,5-8".
File_list is requested only if no file number is given in tape_file.
Files will be read in ascending order, regardless of the order of the list.
Reading
will terminate if EOT is reached, thus a list such as "1-999"
may be used to read all the files on the tape.
.le
.ls headers=yes
Decode and print header information from each file examined.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
By default, vtexamine decodes and prints header and record
structure information for each file examined.  The header
information can be turned off by setting headers=no.
.ih
EXAMPLES
1. To see the header information and determine the record structure of all the
files on a vacuum telescope tape and send the result to the file vtdump:

.nf
	vt> vtexamine mtb1600 1-999 > vtdump
.fi

2. To just get the record structure for the third file on a vacuum telescope
tape the command would be:

.nf
	vt> vtexamine mtb1600[3] headers=no
.fi
.ih
BUGS
The IRAF magtape i/o routines do not permit data beyond a double EOF
to be accessed. Therefore vtexamine cannot be used to examine tapes with
embedded double EOFs.
