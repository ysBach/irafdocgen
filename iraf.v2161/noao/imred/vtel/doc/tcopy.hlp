.ls input_fd
Tape file or device name for input, e.g. "mta1600[1]" or "mtb800"
.le
.ls files
List of tape file numbers or ranges delimited by commas, e.g. "1-3,5-8".
`Files' is requested only if no file number is given in `input_fd'.
Files will be read in ascending order, reguardless of the order of the list.
Reading will terminate if EOT is reached, thus a list such as "1-999"
may be used to read all the files on the tape.
.le
.ls output_fd
File or device name, e.g. "mta1600[1]" or "mtb800"  If a file number is not
given the user will be asked whether or not this is a new tape.  If it is
a new tape the file number "1" will be used.  If it is not a new tape, i.e. 
it already has data on it, then file number "EOT" will be used.
.le
.ls new_tape = no
New tape flag.  Usage is described above.
.le
.ls verbose = no

DESCRIPTION
Tcopy copies files from one tape to another reporting read errors on the
input tape as it goes.  Tcopy, when it encounters a read error, does its
best to get as much data as possible by validating the input buffer after
the error, guessing its length, and writing it out to the output tape.
