DESCRIPTION
Vtblink allows the user to blink successive frames of data on the IIS.  The
program calculates the offset between grams based on the
longitudes for each image.  Vtblink will ask for each successive image 
and will display it on the next (mod 4) IIS frame.
After each image is displayed the user is put back out in the cl so that he/she
can use any of the images$tv tasks to analyze the data.  The user returns to
the blink program by typing 'bye' to the cl prompt.  To exit the program the
user enters the "end" for the filename.  Images are displayed with the grayscale
limits set by default to -3000.0 and 3000.0.  These values correspond to the
parameters z1 and z2 which may be given on the command line.  If the user
forgets which IIS frame contains which image, he/she can enter "stat" to the
"next image" prompt and will get a list of which images are in which frames.
