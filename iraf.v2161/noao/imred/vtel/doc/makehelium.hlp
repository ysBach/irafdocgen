DESCRIPTION
Makehelium takes the files output by 'destreak5' and projects them the
small [180x180] maps.  The input files are expected to be in the current
directory and have the extensions '1' thru '5'.  The output files are
stored in the current directory with the extensions 'a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'b1', etc.
This coding scheme is the same as that used in makeimages.  Note that the
absolute value images for 10830 grams should be thrown out since they are
garbage.
Makehelium calls 'rmap' and 'imdelete' and is a cl script file.
