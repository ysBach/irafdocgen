noao$mtlocal/cyber/rrcopy/t_rrcopy.x, rcrheader.x
	Fixed two places in t_rrcopy where the procedure was returning 
	without closing the mt file.  Procedure rc_read_header was
	not returning the value (OK) when NOT at EOF.  These two errors,
	while present all along, had not been seen until rrcopy was modified
	to read tapes with more then one datafile; see below.  (4-AUG-88 ShJ)

noao$mtlocal/cyber/rrcopy/t_rrcopy.x
	Added a hidden parameter "datafile" to the rrcopy task.  This 
	allows more than one file of rcopy format data per tape.  With
	this "extension" to the rcopy format, many rcopy files can be
	archived on a single tape.  (26-JULY-88 ShJ)
