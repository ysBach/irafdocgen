PDSREAD (dataio)              PDS Reader                PDSREAD (dataio)



NAME
     pdsread -- Convert Kitt Peak PDS image files to IRAF image files


USAGE
     pds [pds_file, file_list, iraf_file]


DESCRIPTION
     Kitt  Peak PDS format image data is read from the specified source,
     either  a  disk  file  or  magnetic  tape.   The  PDS  header   may 
     optionally  be  printed  on  the  standard  output as either a full
     listing or a short  description.   Image  data  may  optionally  be
     converted to an IRAF image of specified data type.


PARAMETERS

     pds_file
         The  PDS  data source.  If the data source is a disk file or an
         explict tape file specification of the form mt*[n] where  n  is
         a  file  number  then  only  that  file  is  converted.  If the
         general tape device name  is  given,  i.e.  mta,  mtb800,  etc,
         then  the  files  specified by the files parameter will be read
         from the tape.

     file_list
         The files  to  be  read  from  a  tape  are  specified  by  the
         file_list  string.   The  string can consist of any sequence of
         file numbers separated by at least one  of  whitespace,  comma,
         or  dash.   A dash specifies a range of files.  For example the
         string

         1 2, 3 - 5,8-6

         will convert the files 1 through 8.

     iraf_file
         The  IRAF  file  which  will  receive  the  PDS  data  if   the 
         read_image  parameter  switch is set.  For tape files specified
         by the file_list parameter the  filename  will  be  used  as  a
         prefix  and  the file number will be appended.   Otherwise, the
         file will be named as specified.  Thus, reading files 1  and  3
         from  a  PDS  tape  with  a  filename  of data will produce the
         files data1 and data3.  It is legal to use a null filename.

     read_image
         This switch determines whether PDS image data is  converted  to


                                  -1-

         an  IRAF  image  file.  This switch is set to no to obtain just
         header  information  with  the  long_header   or   short_header 
         switches.

     long_header
         If  this  switch  is  set the full PDS header is printed on the
         standard output.

     short_header
         If this switch is set  only  the  output  filename,  the  title
         string, and the image dimensions are printed.

     standard_format
         The PDS standard format has the most significant byte first.

     data_type
         The  IRAF  image  file may be of a different data type than the
         PDS image data.  The data  type  may  be  specified  as  s  for
         short,  l  for  long,  and r for real.  The user must beware of
         truncation  problems  if  an   inappropriate   data   type   is 
         specified.   If  an  incorrect  data_type  or  a null string is
         given for this parameter then  a  default  data  type  is  used
         which  is  the  appropriate  minimum  size  for the input pixel
         values.
