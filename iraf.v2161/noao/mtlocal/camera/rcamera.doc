NAME
    rcamera -- Convert Kitt Peak CAMERA image files to IRAF image files
    
    
USAGE
    rcamera [camera_file, file_list, iraf_file]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Kitt Peak CAMERA format  image  data  is  read  from  the  specified
    source;  either a disk file or magnetic tape.  The CAMERA header may
    optionally be printed on  the  standard  output  as  either  a  full
    listing  or  a  short  description.   Image  data  may optionally be
    converted to an IRAF image of specified data type.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    camera_file
        The CAMERA data source.  If the data source is a  disk  file  or
        an  explict  tape  file specification of the form mt*[n] where n
        is a file number then only  that  file  is  converted.   If  the
        general  tape  device name is given, i.e. mta, mtb800, etc, then
        the files specified by the files parameter  will  be  read  from
        the tape.
    
    file_list
        The  files to be read from a tape are specified by the file_list
        string.  The string can consist of any sequence of file  numbers
        separated  by  at  least  one  of whitespace, comma, or dash.  A
        dash specifies a range of files.  For example the string
        
        1 2, 3 - 5,8-6
        
        will convert the files 1 through 8.
    
    iraf_file
        The IRAF  file  which  will  receive  the  CAMERA  data  if  the
        read_image  parameter  switch  is set.  For tape files specified
        by the file_list parameter  the  filename  will  be  used  as  a
        prefix  and  the  file number will be appended.   Otherwise, the
        file will be named as specified.  Thus, reading files  1  and  3
        from  a  CAMERA  tape  with  a filename of data will produce the
        files data1 and data3.  It is legal to use a null filename.
    
    make_image
        This switch determines whether CAMERA image  data  is  converted
        to  an IRAF image file.  This switch is set to no to obtain just
        header  information  with  the   long_header   or   short_header 
        switches.
    
    long_header
        If  this  switch is set the full CAMERA header is printed on the
        standard output.
    
    short_header
        If this switch is  set  only  the  output  filename,  the  title
        string, and the image dimensions are printed.
    
    standard_format
        The  CAMERA  standard  format  has  the  least  significant byte
        first.  Some CAMERA data, however, does  not  follow  this  byte
        order  convention.   Thus,  to read the non-standard CAMERA data
        this parameter is set to no.
    
    datatype
        The IRAF image file may be of a different  data  type  than  the
        CAMERA  image  data.   The  data  type may be specified as s for
        short, l for long, r for real, and d for double.  The user  must
        beware  of  truncation problems if an inappropriate data type is
        specified.  If an incorrect data_type or a null string is  given
        for  this  parameter  then  a default data type is used which is
        the appropriate minimum size for the input pixel values.
