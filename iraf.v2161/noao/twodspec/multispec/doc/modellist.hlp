NAME
modellist -- List data and model pixel values
.ih
USAGE
modellist image lines
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
Image whose model is to be listed.
.le
.ls lines
Sample lines to be listed.
.le
.ls model = "gauss5"
Profile model to be used to create the model line.
The only model currently defined is \fIgauss5\fR.
.le
.ls columns = "*"
Image columns to be listed.
.le
.ls naverage = 20
The number of image lines to be averaged to form the data values.
.le
.ls lower = -10
Lower limit of model profiles measured in pixels from the spectra centers.
.le
.ls upper = 10
Upper limit of model profiles measured in pixels from the spectra centers.

DESCRIPTION
The model of the image for the selected sample \fIlines\fR
are used to generate model image lines.  Only the model \fIgauss5\fR is
currently available.  The output format is column, sample line, image pixel
value, and model pixel value.  The image pixel data are formed by averaging
\fInaverage\fR lines about the sample lines.
.ih
EXAMPLES
To list the image and model pixel values for the first sample line after
fitting the \fIgauss5\fR model with \fBfitgauss5\fR:

	cl> modellist image 1 >outputlist

The list file \fIoutputlist\fR can be used with the \fBlists\fR and
\fBplot\fR packages to graph the image and model lines or to compute
and graph residuals.
