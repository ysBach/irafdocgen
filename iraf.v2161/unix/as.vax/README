AS - Assembler Sources

This directory contains any (non-kernel) files which it has proven
desirable to optimize in assembler.  Most of these routines are not
required for the operation of the system, although considerable gains
in speed may be possible in some cases.  If the autogeneration routines
cannot find a particular assembler file, the portable routine will
automatically be used instead.

The following assembler files are required:

	zsvjmp.s	(libos.a)

The following should normally be optimized in assembler, particularly if the
machine has special memory move or bitfield instructions:

	aclr.s		clear a block of memory
	amov.s		move a block of memory
	bitpak.s	write into a bit field
	bitupk.s	read from a bit field
	bytmov.s	a variant on amov.s
	ishift.s	bit shift, also iand, ior (used by NCAR/graphics)

The following can be omitted without significant penalty:

	aaddks.s
	aadds.s
	aluir.s
	aluis.s
	amapr.s
	amaps.s
	awsur.s
	awsus.s
	cyboow.s
