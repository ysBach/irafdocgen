UNIX IRAF/FIO device driver for the IIS Model 75
2 Feb 1896 Dct.; ported to UNIX from VMS 10 Mar 1987 SRo.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the IRAF/FIO driver subroutines for the IIS Model 75
image display.  This directory is self contained.

The model 75 interface is implemented as a transformation on the data stream
for the model 70.  The high level code thinks that it is talking to a model
70; we translate the headers as necessary for the model 75 before passing
them on to the device.  This approach does not provide full access to the
capabilities of the model 75, however the existing high level code is all
written for the model 70 and we are not at present interested in the advanced
features of either display.


Driver Procedures:

	zopm75	-- open + allocate
	zclm75	-- close + deallocate
	zrdm75	-- asynchronous binary read
	zwrm75	-- asynchronous binary write
	zwtm75	-- wait for i/o completion, return status
	zstm75	-- get device status
