SGIDEV -- This directory contains the UNIX dependent sources for the metacode
or bitmap translation programs for all devices supported by the SGI graphics
kernel.  See gio$sgikern or `help sgikern' for further information on SGI.

To add a new SGI device:

	[1] Add source file for translator to this directory.
	[2] Add references to mkpkg.csh and mkpkg.
	[3] Run `mkpkg update' in this directory to install new translator.

	[4] Add entry to graphcap file, including DD command string
		containing host command to dispose of the output.

	[5] Test new device interface.

Alternatively, you might wish to install the source for the translator in
local somewhere, to avoid a merge operation when a new version of the VMS
host system interface is installed.
                       
Note that some example graphcap entries for SGI devices might require non-
standard tasks residing outside of IRAF, for example the `impress300'
command to ship Impress output from a UNIX node to a VMS node running
Eunice in order to execute the VMS IMPRINT command.  These are considered
so unusual that support is not included in the standard system.
