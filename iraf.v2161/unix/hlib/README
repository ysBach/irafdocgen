HLIB -- Host system library.  All global library files which are machine at all
	host system dependent are placed in this library, rather than in lib$.

cllogout.cl		log out of the CL (not normally host dependent)
clpackage.cl		contains host system dependent device names
config.h		very host dependent
iraf.h			potentially host dependent
irafuser.csh		sets up UNIX/CSH environment for IRAF
libc			the C runtime library header files (mostly portable)
login.cl		default login.cl file (contains device names)
mach.h			machine constants (machine dependent)
mkiraf.csh		set up UNIX/IRAF files for a user
zzsetenv.def		environment startup file (contains device names)
