XPP -- First pass of the SPP preprocessor.

    This directory contains the Lex and C sources for the first pass of the
preprocessor for the IRAF SPP (subset preprocessor) language.  XPP takes as
input an SPP source file and produces as output a text file which is further
processed by RPP (the second pass) to produce Fortran.
