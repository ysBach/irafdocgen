NAME
rmbin -- find/remove binary files in subdirectories
.ih
USAGE
rmbin [-dinrv] [-o extns] [-e extns] dir1 dir2 ... dirN
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls 4 -d
Disable recursive descent into subdirectories.
.le
.ls 4 -e extns
Exclude files with the listed extensions (whitespace delimited).
.le
.ls 4 -i
Verify before deleting files without extensions.  Files with well known
extensions like ".[aoe]" are deleted without a query.  A heuristic (ZFACSS)
is used to determine the filetype of files with unknown extensions, and
it can fail, though in practice it works quite well.
.le
.ls 4 -n
No execute; do not delete files.  This option may be used to generate
a list of binary files for some purpose other than deletion.  For example,
on a UNIX host, the following command will compute the disk space used
by the binary files in a directory tree:

	% du `rmbin -n .`

The -n option, of course, is also useful for verifying the delete operation
before destroying the files.
.le
.ls 4 -o extns
Delete only files with the listed extensions (whitespace delimited).
.le
.ls 4 -r
Reenable recursive descent.  Recursive descent is the default, however
it may be turned off at one point in the command line, and later reenabled
with this switch.
.le
.ls 4 -v
Print names of files as they are deleted.
.le

Note that flags may be inserted between directory name arguments to change
switches for different directories.

DESCRIPTION
The \fIrmbin\fR task is used to descend a directory tree, deleting (or listing)
all the binary files therein.  The task may also be used to delete or list
nonbinary files by explicitly listing their extensions.

\fIRmbin\fR is used the strip the IRAF system down to the sources, prior to
a full system rebuild.  After changing to the IRAF root directory, one runs
\fIrmbin\fR to delete all the binaries in lib, sys, pkg, etc. (but \fInot\fR
in hlib, else a bootstrap will be necessary too).  \fIMkpkg\fR is then run
to recompile the system; this currently takes about 20 hours on our UNIX
11/750 development system, provided nothing else is running on the system.

EXAMPLES
1. Delete all binaries in the pkg and sys directories of IRAF.  The example
is for a UNIX host, but this works for all other IRAF hosts as well.

.nf
	% cd $iraf
	% rmbin -v pkg sys
.fi
