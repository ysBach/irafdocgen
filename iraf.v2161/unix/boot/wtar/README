WTAR -- Write a tar format file or tape.  This is a portable, non-UNIX, non-
	proprietary program for writing tar format files on a variety of
	systems.  The TAR format is an excellent choice for transporting
	files between different machines because of its simplicity, efficiency,
	and machine independence.


wtar [-tvdo] [-f tarfile] [files]

	-t	print names of files as they are written
	-v	verbose output
	-d	debug mode
	-o	omit binary files
	-f fn	write to file FN (stdout, mt[ab..], binary file)
	[files]	files or directories to be written to tar file


Output may be to a disk file, a magtape device, or to the standard output
(on some systems).  Text files may be padded with extra blanks at the end on
some systems, due to lack of knowledge of the precise file length when the
file header is written.
