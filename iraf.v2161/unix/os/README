4.2BSD UNIX IRAF Kernel.

    This directory contains the machine dependent routines comprising the IRAF
system interface to UNIX 4.2BSD.  Some additional potentially machine dependent
routines (the bit and byte primitives) are in sys$osb.  Documentation is in
the System Interface Reference manual doc$Os.ms and the manual pages for the
individual routines are in the subdirectory ./doc.
