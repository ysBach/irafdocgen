NAME
zfacss -- determine the accessibility and type of a file
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
zfacss (osfn, mode, type, status)

packed	char osfn[]		# host filename
int	mode			# access mode to be checked
int	type			# file type to be tested
int	status			# is file accessible as specified
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Determine if a file is accessible with the indicated access modes and whether
or not the file is of the indicated type.  If either \fImode\fR or \fItype\fR is
zero it is not checked; if both are zero, only the existence of the file
is checked.  Legal access modes are 0, READ_ONLY, READ_WRITE, WRITE_ONLY, and
APPEND.  Legal file types are 0, TEXT_FILE, and BINARY_FILE.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
YES is returned if the file is accessible with the indicated mode and type;
NO is returned otherwise.
.ih
NOTES
On some systems (e.g. UNIX) it is necessary to actually read part of the file
to test whether or not it is a text file, since the OS does not discriminate
between text and binary files.  Hence use of \fBzfacss\fR to check the file
type is an expensive operation on some systems.
There is no guarantee that the accessibility of a file will not change between
the time \fBzfacss\fR is called and before the file is opened.
