NAME
zfmkcp -- make a zero length copy of a file
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
zfmkcp (osfn, new_osfn, status)

packed	char osfn[]			# name of original file
packed	char new_osfn[]			# name of new file
int	status
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
A zero length file is created which inherits all the machine dependent
attributes (so far as is possible) of the original file.  No file data
is copied.  The new file need not reside in the same directory as the
original file.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned if the original file cannot be accessed, if the new file
cannot be created, or if the file cannot be accessed as either a text or binary
file.  OK is returned if the operation is successful.
.ih
NOTES
The newly created file is normally opened for writing as a text or binary
file immediately after creation with \fBzfmkcp\fR.  The IRAF system has
no knowledge of the machine dependent attributes of a file, e.g., execute
permission, cross-directory links, special permissions, and so on.

FIO ensures that a file will not already exist named \fInew_osfn\fR when
\fBzfmkcp\fR is called.  If such a file exists and file clobber is enabled,
FIO will delete the file before calling \fBzfmkcp\fR.  If file clobber
is disabled and a file already exists with the new name, FIO will take an
error action.
