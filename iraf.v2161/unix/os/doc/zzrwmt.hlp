NAME
zzrwmt -- rewind magtape
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
zzrwmt (chan, status)

int	chan			# OS channel of magtape
int	status
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
A rewind of the magnetic tape opened on channel \fIchan\fR is initiated.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned if the tape is offline or if \fIchan\fR is illegal.
OK is returned if the operation is successful.
.ih
NOTES
The rewind is not guaranteed to be asynchronous.  There is no wait primitive
for the rewind operation; it is assumed that the host driver or the kernel
will automatically suspend any further tape motion commands issued before
the rewind is completed.  If the host system does not have the ability to
asynchronously rewind a magtape then \fBzzrwmt\fR is equivalent to a call
to \fBzzopmt\fR to open file 1 on a tape.
