NAME
zcall -- call an external procedure by reference
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
zcall1 (procedure, arg1)
zcall2 (procedure, arg1, arg2)
zcall3 (procedure, arg1, arg2, arg3)
zcall4 (procedure, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)
zcall5 (procedure, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)

int	procedure		# reference to external procedure
arb	arg1, ..., arg\fIn\fR		# arguments for external procedure
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The subroutine referenced by the magic integer passed as the first argument
is called as a subprocedure.  The \fIn\fR arguments to \fBzcall\fR are passed
to the subprocedure by reference; the datatypes of the actual arguments are
unknown but the number and datatypes of the arguments must match those
expected by the subprocedure.  The arguments are restricted to variables,
constants, arrays, and array elements of datatypes \fBcsilrd\fR.  The magic
integer \fIprocedure\fR must have been obtained by a prior call to \fBzlocpr\fR.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
Any of the arguments may be used to return a value depending on the
significance of the argument to the subprocedure called.
The procedure itself may not return a value, i.e., \fBzcall\fR may not
be used to call a function.
.ih
NOTES
The arguments to \fIprocedure\fR must not be Fortran CHARACTER variables
or constants, external procedures, or objects of datatype complex.
