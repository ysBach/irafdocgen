.help zpanic May84 "System Interface"

NAME
zpanic -- terminate process execution unconditionally
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
zpanic (errcode, errmsg)

int	errcode			# exit status
packed	char errmsg[]		# error message
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The error message \fIerrmsg\fR is written to the process standard error
output and the process terminates, returning \fIerrcode\fR to the parent
process as the exit status.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
This procedure does not return.
.ih
NOTES
The process standard error output is not well-defined.  The kernel implementor
may hook the process standard error stream to whatever device seems most
appropriate on the host system.  If the process was spawned interactively
this will probably be the user terminal.  If the process is running in a
batch queue a file might be a better choice.  Do not confuse the process
standard error output with the pseudofile STDERR.
