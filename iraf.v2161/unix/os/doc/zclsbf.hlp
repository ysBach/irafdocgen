NAME
zclsbf -- close a binary file
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
zclsbf (chan, status)

int	chan			# OS channel of binary file
int	status
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The binary file associated with the channel \fIchan\fR is closed, i.e.,
the file is disassociated from the process which opened it and freed for
access by some other process, and the channel is freed for use with another
file.  A binary file must be closed before process termination or the integrity
of the file is not guaranteed.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned in \fIstatus\fR for an illegal \fIchan\fR.  OK is returned
if the operation is successful.
.ih
NOTES
The IRAF Main guarantees that all files will be closed prior to process
shutdown.  The Main will also close all open files at program termination
unless the program explicitly indicates that a file is to be left open.
