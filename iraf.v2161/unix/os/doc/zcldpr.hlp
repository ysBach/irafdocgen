NAME
zcldpr -- close a detached process
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
zcldpr (jobcode, killflag, exit_status)

int	jobcode			# code by which job is known to system
int	killflag		# if YES, kill bkg job
int	exit_status		# exit status of bkg job
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
If \fIkillflag\fR is NO, process execution will be suspended until
the background job terminates.  If \fIkillflag\fR is YES the background
job is dequeued if it has not yet been run, or is killed if it is currently
executing.  The integer \fIjobcode\fR is the magic number assigned the
job by the \fBzopdpr\fR primitive.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned for an illegal \fIjobcode\fR or for an attempt to kill
a job without the necessary permissions.  If the operations completes
successfully the exit status of the process, i.e., OK or a positive integer
error code, is returned in \fIexit_status\fR.
.ih
NOTES
The CL calls this procedure whenever it detects that a background job has
terminated, since a background job may be run as a subprocess on some systems
and since it may be necessary to perform special actions after a subprocess has
terminated.  The CL also calls this procedure whenever the user \fBkills\fR a
background job, or when the user wishes to \fBwait\fR for a background job to
terminate.
