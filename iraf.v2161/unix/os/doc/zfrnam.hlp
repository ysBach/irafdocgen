.ih
NAME
zfrnam -- rename a file
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
zfrnam (old_osfn, new_osfn, status)

packed	char old_osfn[]		# OS name of existing file
packed	char new_osfn[]		# new OS name of file
int	status
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The name of file \fIold_osfn\fR is changed to \fInew_osfn\fR.
All file attributes are preserved by the rename operation.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned if the old file does not exist or if the rename operation
cannot be performed.  OK is returned if the operation is successful.
If the operation is unsuccessful the original file is not affected in any
way.
.ih
NOTES
Ideally the rename operation should be successful even if the new filename
does not reference the same directory as the old filename, allowing a file
to be moved from one directory to another without physically copying the
file.  If this is not possible ERR should be returned and the high level
code (e.g., \fBsystem.movefiles\fR) must physically copy the file.

FIO ensures that a file will not already exist named \fInew_osfn\fR when
\fBzfrnam\fR is called.  If such a file exists and file clobber is enabled,
FIO will delete the file before calling \fBzfrnam\fR.  If file clobber
is disabled and a file already exists with the new name, FIO will take an
error action.  File protection does not prevent renaming a file.
