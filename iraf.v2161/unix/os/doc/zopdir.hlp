NOTES
A directory file is opened at the kernel level with \fBzopdir\fR,
is read with \fBzgfdir\fR, and is closed with \fBzcldir\fR.
A directory file is viewed by the high level code as a simple list of
OS filenames; a directory file is interfaced to FIO as a text file and
successive filenames are read by the high level code with \fBgetline\fR.
The text file driver for a directory file is machine independent and
serves only as an interface between FIO and the three directory access
primitives.
