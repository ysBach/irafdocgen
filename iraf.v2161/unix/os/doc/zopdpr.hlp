NAME
zopdpr -- open a detached process
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
zopdpr (process_name, bkgfile, jobcode)

packed	char process_name[]		# executable file name
packed	char bkgfile[]			# job file
int	jobcode				# job number of bkg job
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
A background job is queued for execution at some unspecifiable future time.
The process named by the executable file \fIprocess_name\fR will eventually
execute as a detached process, i.e., independently of the parent process.
When the process runs it will read the file \fIbkgfile\fR to determine what
to do.  The format of the background file is application dependent.
Deletion of the background file indicates that the background job
has terminated.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned if the background job cannot be queued for some reason.
If the operation is successful \fIjobcode\fR contains the positive nonzero
magic integer assigned by the kernel or by the host system to the job.
.ih
NOTES
The background job may execute immediately or may be placed in a queue
and executed at some later time, depending on the implementation chosen
for a particular host system.  The significance of \fIjobcode\fR is
machine dependent.
