NAME
zintpr -- interrupt a process
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
zintpr (pid, exception, status)

int	pid		# process id of process to be interrupted
int	exception	# exception to be raised
int	status
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The indicated virtual exception is raised in the process associated with
the process-id \fIpid\fR.  Currently only the interrupt exception X_INT
may be sent to a process.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned for a bad process-id.  OK is returned if the operation
is successful.
.ih
NOTES
The exception X_INT is also raised by the host terminal driver when
the interrupt control sequence is typed by the user at the terminal.
If the identical exception cannot be raised by a user process it may
be possible to use a different exception and have the kernel map both
to X_INT.  In principle it should be possible for a process to interrupt
itself, though this capability may be machine dependent.
