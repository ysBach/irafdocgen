DESCRIPTION
The machine dependent command \fIcmd\fR is executed by the standard host
command interpreter.  Control does not return until the host has finished
executing the command.  If either of the filenames \fIstdout\fR or \fIstderr\fR
is nonnull the kernel will attempt to append the referenced output stream
to the named textfile, which will be created if necessary.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned if an error occurred during execution of the command.
OK is returned if the command was executed successfully.
.ih
NOTES
This primitive may not be available in all implementations and any program
