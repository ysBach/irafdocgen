DESCRIPTION
The \fBzgtime\fR primitive returns the local standard time (clock time)
in long integer seconds since midnight on January 1, 1980, and the
cpu time consumed by the calling process and all subproceses since process
creation in milliseconds.  No allowance is made for time zones or daylight
savings time.

When daylight savings time goes into effect there is a one hour interval
during which the time base is ambiguous.  A different time base whould have
to be used for a distributed system spanning several time zones.
