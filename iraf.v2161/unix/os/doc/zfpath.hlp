NAME
zfpath -- convert an OSFN into an absolute pathname
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
zfpath (osfn, pathname, maxch, status)

char	osfn[ARB]		# OS filename
char	pathname[maxch]		# absolute pathname equiv. of OSFN
int	maxch, status
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Return the absolute pathname equivalent of an OS filename.  An absolute pathname
is an OSFN which does not depend on the current working directory.
If the argument \fIosfn\fR is null the pathname of the current working
directory is returned.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned if the translation cannot be performed for any reason,
or if the output string overflows.  If the operation is successful the
number of characters in the output string is returned.
.ih
NOTES
This primitive is normally coded in SPP since it does not communicate
with the host system.  Character string arguments are therefore not packed.
